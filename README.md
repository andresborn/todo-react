# To Do List with Backend in React

While building this To Do list we learned:

React:

- Controlled components
- Data flow inside our app:
  - Passing down props to components
  - Passing up data from components to state via functions

API's:

- Getting data with `fetch()` and rendering it
- Updating our data
